- 👋 Hi, I’m Koki Agata. I am a self-taught programmer with experiences in both front-end and back-end programming. I am mostly using JavaScript and its middledwares, but also learning other languages to expand my expertise.
- 👀 I’m interested more so in back-end programming, but I also enjoy creating responsive front-end projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can contribute!
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail
